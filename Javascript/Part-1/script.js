what is a variable?
     ~ A variable is a container for storing data values.

Data-Types in JavaScript:
     ~ JavaScript has dynamic typing, meaning you don't have to declare the data type of a variable.
       The data type is determined automatically based on the value assigned to the variable.
     ~ Common data types include:
           - Number: Represents numeric values (e.g., 10, 3.14).
           - String: Represents text (e.g., "Hello, World!").
           - Boolean: Represents true or false values.
           - Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
           - Null: Represents an intentional absence of any value.
           - Object: A collection of key-value pairs.
           - Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections.


           number in js :-
               ~ Numbers in JavaScript can be integers or floating-point numbers.
               ~ JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 standard for representing numbers, which allows for a wide range of values.
               ~ Numbers can be written with or without decimals, and they can also be expressed in exponential notation.
// Example of declaring a variable and assigning a number
let a = 10; // Using 'let' to declare a variable
// Example of declaring a variable and assigning a number
let a = 10; // Using 'let' to declare a variable
*/

a = 20

console.log(a);
